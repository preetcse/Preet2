# Important OAuth Configuration Note

## Your Current OAuth Setup

I see you have configured:
- **Redirect URI**: `https://legendary-preet.ct.ws/google_callback.php`

## For This JavaScript Application

**The redirect URI you configured won't be used** because this is a **client-side JavaScript application** that uses Google's **implicit flow**.

### What You Need Instead

For this application to work, you need to configure **"Authorized JavaScript origins"** in your OAuth settings:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
2. **APIs & Services > Credentials** 
3. **Click your OAuth Client ID**: `2633417852-d1qhnoi6rlgb191l7h0ohtfoiiduivmb`
4. **In "Authorized JavaScript origins", add**:
   - `https://legendary-preet.ct.ws`
   - `https://preetcse.github.io` (if using GitHub Pages)
   - `http://localhost:8000` (for local testing)

### The Redirect URI Can Stay

You can keep the redirect URI (`https://legendary-preet.ct.ws/google_callback.php`) - it won't interfere with the JavaScript application. It might be useful for other integrations.

### How Our Application Works

- **No server-side redirect needed**
- **JavaScript handles the OAuth flow directly**
- **Google popup appears and closes automatically**
- **Access token is handled in the browser**

This is a more modern, secure approach for client-side applications!

## Summary

âœ… Keep your current OAuth Client ID  
âœ… Keep the redirect URI if you want  
ðŸ”§ **Just add the "Authorized JavaScript origins"**  
ðŸ”§ **Create the API Key**  
ðŸ”§ **Update the configuration in app.js**

Then your Google Drive integration will work perfectly!
