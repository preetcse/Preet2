- Web hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

### 1. Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or use existing one
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Get your Firebase config from Project Settings > General > Your apps
5. Update the `firebaseConfig` object in `app.js`:

```javascript
this.firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

### 2. Google Drive API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Google Drive API
4. Create credentials (API Key and OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
5. Configure OAuth consent screen
6. Add authorized domains for your app

#### Getting API Credentials:

**API Key:**
1. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
3. Restrict the key to Google Drive API

**OAuth 2.0 Client ID:**
1. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
3. Choose "Web application"
4. Add your domain to authorized origins

#### Update Configuration:
```javascript
this.googleDriveConfig = {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY',
    clientId: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID',
    discoveryDoc: 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v3/rest',
    scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'
};
```

### 3. Google Drive Folder Setup

1. Create a folder in Google Drive for bill storage
2. Get the folder ID from the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`
3. Update the folder ID in `app.js`:

```javascript
const metadata = {
    name: `${customerName}_${transactionType}_${Date.now()}_${file.name}`,
    parents: ['YOUR_FOLDER_ID'], // Replace with your folder ID
    description: `Bill for ${customerName} - ${transactionType}`
};
```

### 4. Security Configuration

#### Change Default Password:
Update the password in `app.js`:
```javascript
this.PASSWORD = 'your_secure_password'; // Change this!
```

#### Firestore Security Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Update with proper authentication
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Deployment

1. Upload all files to your web hosting service
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA features)
3. Test all functionality including:
   - Customer creation
   - Sales recording with image upload
   - Payment processing
   - Data synchronization

## üì± Usage Guide

### Features

- Implement custom reporting in the Reports section
- Add more customer fields as needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Production Deployment:
1. **Change the default password** immediately
2. **Secure Firebase rules** with proper authentication
3. **Restrict API keys** to your domain only
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive config
5. **Enable HTTPS** for all connections

### Data Privacy:
- Customer data is stored in Firebase (Google's secure cloud)
- Bill images are stored in Google Drive with restricted access
- Local storage is used only for caching and offline support

## üìä Database Structure

### Customers Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  name: "Customer Name",
  phone: "1234567890",
  address: "Customer Address",
  totalDebt: 0,
  createdDate: Timestamp,
  lastUpdated: Timestamp
}
```

### Transactions Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  customerId: "customer-id",
  type: "sale" | "payment",
  amount: 1000.00,
  description: "Transaction description",
  billImageUrl: "https://drive.google.com/...",
  timestamp: Timestamp
}
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Firebase data loads only when needed
- **Local Caching**: Customer and transaction data cached locally
- **Image Compression**: Consider compressing images before upload
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple Firebase operations batched together

## üîÑ Backup and Recovery

### Data Export
- Use the "Export Data" button to download JSON backup
- Export includes customers, transactions, and metadata
- Regular backups recommended

### Data Import
- Implement custom import functionality if needed
- Consider CSV import for bulk customer data

## üìû Support

For issues or customization requests:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase and Google Drive API configurations
3. Test with different browsers and devices
4. Check network connectivity for sync issues
